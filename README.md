This is the Webpack boilerplate that I use for my projects. 

Download or clone the project on your local drive. Open Terminal (Command prompt) and navigate to the project folder. Then run ```npm install```. You should see a new folder called **node_modules** in the project folder.

From the terminal, inside the project folder, run ``` npm start``` command to start the server. You now can visit *localhost:3000* in your browser to access the home page.
